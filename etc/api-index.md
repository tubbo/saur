# Deno Saur API Reference

Welcome to the reference documentation for [Deno Saur][guides]! Here you'll
find detailed information about every object and its methods in the Saur
framework.

This documentation is [automatically generated][workflow] when code is
pushed to the `master` branch, so you can be sure it's always up-to-date
with the latest changes.

See something missing? Create a [pull request][] and contribute some
docs! All documentation is contained in the repository, with the
[guides][] located in the `docs/` directory, and the reference
documentation located within [ESDoc][] comments throughout the codebase.
Help us out by editing or creating new guides and/or documentation for
the code!
